# SSML

Core EE's Cloud Text-To-Speech feature allows you to produce audio from text and SSML  

### Prerequisites

* Make sure your Core EE endpoint runs correctly with your current configuration
* Enable [Cloud Text-to-Speech API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/google/texttospeech.googleapis.com) in your project

### Usage

Enable and configure "Automatic Text-To-Speech" in your Dialogflow Settings

Core EE will resolve the settings automatically and use them to generate the audio response

**Note**: the audio is encoded in base64
